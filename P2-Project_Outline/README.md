# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The purpose of my website will be to allow users to collaborate on various music projects.  It will allow the user to find other people to collaborate that they normally wouldnt have access to. Ideally bigger artists would join the platform with the focus of collaborating with "smaller" talent.  This could drive traffic just due to big names utilizing the platform.  This could also be a way for A&R reps to find talent through the platform.(These are big tasks im striving for but with the right marketing it could work)  The site will allow users to search for different genres in order to connect with like minded artists, producers, singers, bands etc.  This site wil serve as a social network for artist to be able to collab, discuss, and interact with eachother using the various features provided.  The site will function almost in the same way that reddit does.  It will allow users to create different groups to further the discussion on anything music related. Eventually i would like for users to be able to collaborate on anyting but honing in on music would be much more feasable starting out.
